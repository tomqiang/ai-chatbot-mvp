PWA Icon Requirements
=====================

For iOS standalone mode to work properly, you need to add icon files to this directory:

Required files:
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons are referenced in app/manifest.ts and will be used when users add the app to their iPhone Home Screen.

You can create these icons using any image editor. Make sure they are:
- PNG format
- Square (equal width and height)
- At least the specified pixel dimensions
- Optimized for web (compressed but still clear)
